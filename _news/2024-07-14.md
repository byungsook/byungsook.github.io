I'm super excited to share that our paper, "Deep Fluids: A Generative Network for Parameterized Fluid Simulations", has been selected as a recipient of the [2024 Frontiers of Science Award](https://www.icbs.cn/site/pages/index/index?pageId=2cd3eaea-5f56-4cb1-9276-5a3a9ca39223) at the International Congress of Basic Science.
