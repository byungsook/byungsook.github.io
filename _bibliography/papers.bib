abstract = {Active soft bodies can affect their shape through an internal actuation mechanism that induces a deformation. Similar to recent work, this paper utilizes a differentiable, quasi-static, and physics-based simulation layer to optimize for actuation signals parameterized by neural networks. Our key contribution is a general and implicit formulation to control active soft bodies by defining a function that enables a continuous mapping from a spatial point in the material space to the actuation value. This property allows us to capture the signal's dominant frequencies, making the method discretization agnostic and widely applicable. We extend our implicit model to mandible kinematics for the particular case of facial animation and show that we can reliably reproduce facial expressions captured with high-quality capture systems. We apply the method to volumetric soft bodies, human poses, and facial expressions, demonstrating artist-friendly properties, such as simple control over the latent space and resolution invariance at test time.},

abstract = {Abstract Creative processes of artists often start with hand-drawn sketches illustrating an object. Pre-visualizing these keyframes is especially challenging when applied to volumetric materials such as smoke. The authored 3D density volumes must capture realistic flow details and turbulent structures, which is highly non-trivial and remains a manual and time-consuming process. We therefore present a method to compute a 3D smoke density field directly from 2D artist sketches, bridging the gap between early-stage prototyping of smoke keyframes and pre-visualization. From the sketch inputs, we compute an initial volume estimate and optimize the density iteratively with an updater CNN. Our differentiable sketcher is embedded into the end-to-end training, which results in robust reconstructions. Our training data set and sketch augmentation strategy are designed such that it enables general applicability. We evaluate the method on synthetic inputs and sketches from artists depicting both realistic smoke volumes and highly non-physical smoke shapes. The high computational performance and robustness of our method at test time allows interactive authoring sessions of volumetric density fields for rapid prototyping of ideas by novice users.},

abstract={This paper introduces the Instructed Glacier Model (IGM) – a model that simulates ice dynamics, mass balance and its coupling to predict the evolution of glaciers, icefields or ice sheets. The novelty of IGM is that it models the ice flow by a Convolutional Neural Network, which is trained from data generated with hybrid SIA + SSA or Stokes ice flow models. By doing so, the most computationally demanding model component is substituted by a cheap emulator. Once trained with representative data, we demonstrate that IGM permits to model mountain glaciers up to 1000 × faster than Stokes ones on Central Processing Units (CPU) with fidelity levels above 90% in terms of ice flow solutions leading to nearly identical transient thickness evolution. Switching to the GPU often permits additional significant speed-ups, especially when emulating Stokes dynamics or/and modelling at high spatial resolution. IGM is an open-source Python code which deals with two-dimensional (2-D) gridded input and output data. Together with a companion library of trained ice flow emulators, IGM permits user-friendly, highly efficient and mechanically state-of-the-art glacier and icefields simulations.},

abstract={Remote magnetic navigation is used for the manipulation of untethered micro and nanorobots, as well as tethered magnetic surgical tools for minimally invasive medicine. Mathematical modeling of the magnetic fields generated by magnetic navigation systems is a fundamental task in the control of such tools for biomedical applications. In this article, we describe and compare several existing and newly developed methods for representations of continuous magnetic fields using interpolation in the context of remote magnetic navigation. Clinical-scale electromagnetic navigation systems feature nonlinear magnetization and magnetization interactions between electromagnets, which renders accurate magnetic field modeling challenging. We first introduce a method that can adapt existing linear models to correct for nonlinear magnetization, with similar performance to the current state-of-the-art nonlinear model. Furthermore, we present a method based on convolutional neural networks.},
