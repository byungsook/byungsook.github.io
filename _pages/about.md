I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/). I received my joint PhD from [Computer Graphics Lab](https://graphics.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) and [Disney Research](https://studios.disneyresearch.com), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Markus Gross](https://graphics.ethz.ch/people/grossm/) and [Dr. Barbara Solenthaler](https://graphics.ethz.ch/~sobarbar/). My research interests span machine learning for physics-based simulation and visual computing.
