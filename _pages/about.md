I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at NVIDIA. I received my joint PhD from [Computer Graphics Lab](https://graphics.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) and [DisneyResearch|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Markus Gross](https://graphics.ethz.ch/people/grossm/) and Dr. Barbara Solenthaler(<https://graphics.ethz.ch/~sobarbar/>). My research interests span machine learning for physics-based simulation and visual computing.
